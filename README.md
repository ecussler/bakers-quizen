Coding Bootcamp Challenge #4 - Web APIs

## Description

This project is my first attempt at building a online quiz using web APIs. The quiz prompts you through question, has a timer, and allows you to input your initials to be logged on the top scores list. The code includes:

- A timer that decrements for each wrong answer. 
- Use of local storage.
- Responsive classes for correct/incorrect answers. 

I had a more difficult time with this project and it is far from perfect. I learned quite a lot building this quiz and looking at it now, I would definitely change a couple of things in my initial startup to make things easier. I'm glad I stuck with my initial code and I've still got some bugs with my TRY AGAIN function but I'm hoping to revisit this topic when I get more reps with JavaScript and Web APIs under my belt.
